## Responsibilities of Project Maintainers

Maintainers play a crucial role in upholding community standards. They will:

* Monitor behavior and intervene when harmful conduct occurs.
* Provide clear, consistent guidance in ambiguous situations.
* Apply this Code of Conduct impartially, regardless of contributor status.
* Document incidents when appropriate and maintain confidentiality.
* Remove or modify contributions (code, issues, comments) that violate these rules.

Maintainers are empowered to take any action they deem necessary to protect the community and the project.

## Reporting a Violation

If you experience or witness misconduct, you may report it through:

* GitHub Issues (for public matters)
* Direct messages to maintainers (for private matters)
* Email (if listed in the repository)

Reports will be handled discreetly and respectfully. Retaliation against reporters will not be tolerated.

## Enforcement Process & Consequences

Violations may lead to one or more of the following, depending on severity:

1. **Informal discussion** to clarify concerns
2. **Official warning** outlining unacceptable behavior
3. **Temporary limitation** on PRs, Issues, or community interaction
4. **Temporary ban** from the repository or community spaces
5. **Permanent removal** from the project and related platforms

Maintainers may bypass intermediate steps for extreme or dangerous behavior.

## Commitment to Growth

We recognize that individuals come from different cultures and technical backgrounds. Mistakes may happen. What matters is a willingness to learn, grow, and improve the community together.
