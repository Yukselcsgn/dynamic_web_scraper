# Tests Package

The `tests/` directory contains the full, enterprise-grade test
architecture for the **Dynamic Web Scraper** project.\
📌 *Note:* The structure is fully implemented, but most test files are
currently **skeletons/placeholders** awaiting full test logic.

This test suite is designed to support:

-   Unit testing\
-   Integration testing\
-   End-to-End (E2E) testing\
-   Performance & stress testing\
-   Security testing\
-   Compatibility & reliability testing\
-   Regression testing\
-   Smoke testing\
-   Benchmarking

It follows a production-level QA/Test Automation architecture similar to
large-scale scraping and data pipeline systems.

## Test Categories (Detailed)

### Unit Tests (`unit/`)

Covers individual modules and components.\
(These are currently scaffolds.)

### Integration Tests (`integration/`)

Validates combined workflows.

### End-to-End Tests (`e2e/`)

Simulates real-world scraping.

### QA Test Suites (`qa/`)

Performance, reliability, security, usability, compatibility &
scalability testing.

### Regression Tests (`regression/`)

Ensures old bugs do not return.

### Benchmark Tests (`benchmark/`)

Performance and latency measurements.

### Smoke Tests (`smoke/`)

Fast sanity checks.

### Fixtures & Mocks

Sample HTML/JSON/CSV files, mock responses, fake servers.

## Running Tests

## Test Markers

Defined in `pytest.ini`: `unit`, `integration`, `e2e`, `smoke`,
`performance`, `slow`, etc.

## Status

✔ Full architecture\
✔ Fixtures, mocks, helpers\
✖ Test logic not yet written (skeleton stage)
