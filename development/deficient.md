# Project Deficiency Report: Dynamic Web Scraper

## 1. **Import and Module Structure Issues**

- **scraper/__init__.py**
  - Uses both absolute and relative imports, which can cause import errors depending on how the package is run (e.g., `from scraper import Scraper` and `from .Scraper import Scraper`).
  - Imports `main` and `load_config` directly, which may not work if the package is not in the Python path.

- **scraper/utils/__init__.py**
  - Uses `from request_utils import send_request`, which will fail unless the current directory is in the Python path. Should use relative import: `from .request_utils import send_request`.

- **scraper/site_detection/__init__.py**
  - Imports `detect_site` from `site_detector`, but no such function exists; the correct function is `detect_site_structure`.

## 2. **Incomplete or Empty Modules**

- **scraper/utils/html_utils.py**: File is empty.
- **scraper/css_selectors/css_rules.py**: File is empty.
- **scraper/css_selectors/css_selector_generator.py**: File is empty.
- **scraper/css_selectors/dynamic_selector.py**: File is empty.
- **scraper/site_detection/css_selector_builder.py**: File is empty.
- **scraper/site_detection/html_analyzer.py**: File is empty.

## 3. **Inconsistent Data Handling**

- **User Agent and Proxy Configuration**
  - `main.py` expects user agents in a JSON file (`user_agents.json`), but the documentation and some utilities expect a TXT file (`user_agents.txt`).
  - Proxy loading is inconsistent: sometimes from `config.json`, sometimes from a TXT file.

- **save_data Usage**
  - `Scraper.py` calls `save_data(products)`, but the function signature in `data_parser.py` expects at least two arguments (`data, file_name`).

## 4. **Testing Deficiencies**

- The `tests/` directory does not cover all modules (e.g., no tests for `utils`, `css_selectors`, or `site_detection`).
- No integration or end-to-end tests for the full scraping workflow.

## 5. **Requirements and Dependency Issues**

- `requirements.txt` includes `MagicMock`, which is not a standalone package (should be `mock` or used from `unittest.mock`).
- No version pinning for dependencies, which may cause compatibility issues.

## 6. **Other Issues**

- **Logging**
  - Multiple log files are created, but log rotation or cleanup is not addressed.
- **Exception Handling**
  - Custom exceptions in `scraper_exceptions.py` require arguments (e.g., `ProxyError(proxy, ...)`), but are sometimes raised without them in the code (e.g., `raise ProxyError("Proxy list is empty!")`).
- **Documentation**
  - Some files and features are referenced in the documentation but are missing or incomplete in the codebase.
