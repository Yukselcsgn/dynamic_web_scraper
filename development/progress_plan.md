# Dynamic Web Scraper: Professional Development & Roadmap

Welcome to the next phase of your signature project! This guide outlines a clear, step-by-step plan to address current deficiencies, elevate the codebase to a professional standard, and introduce advanced features that will set your project apart.

---

## **Phase 1: Addressing Current Deficiencies**

### 1. **Fix Import and Module Structure**
- **Why:** Clean, consistent imports prevent runtime errors and make the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
- **How:**
  - Refactor all `__init__.py` files to use relative imports (e.g., `from .module import ...`).
  - Remove ambiguous absolute imports that can break in different environments.
  - Expose only the necessary classes/functions in `__all__`.
  - Correct function imports (e.g., use `detect_site_structure` instead of `detect_site`).
  - **Tip:** Test imports by running modules both as scripts and as packages.

### 2. **Complete or Remove Empty Modules**
- **Why:** Empty files confuse contributors and users. Every module should have a clear purpose.
- **How:**
  - Implement missing logic in all empty files (e.g., utility functions in `html_utils.py`, selector logic in `css_rules.py`).
  - If a file is not needed, remove it and update documentation.
  - **Example:** Add HTML cleaning helpers to `html_utils.py` (e.g., `def strip_tags(html): ...`).

### 3. **Standardize Data Handling**
- **Why:** Consistent data formats reduce bugs and make onboarding easier.
- **How:**
  - Choose one format for user agent and proxy lists (JSON or TXT) and update all code and docs.
  - Refactor all loading/saving functions to use the chosen format.
  - Ensure all function calls match their signatures (e.g., always provide required arguments to `save_data`).
  - **Tip:** Add data validation and error messages for malformed files.

### 4. **Improve Exception Handling**
- **Why:** Clear, actionable errors help users and developers fix issues quickly.
- **How:**
  - Refactor custom exceptions to require and use the correct arguments.
  - Add try/except blocks around risky operations (network, file I/O, parsing).
  - Provide user-friendly error messages and suggestions.
  - **Example:** When a proxy fails, log the proxy and suggest trying another.

### 5. **Enhance Logging**
- **Why:** Good logs are essential for debugging and monitoring in production.
- **How:**
  - Implement log rotation (e.g., using `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`).
  - Add log cleanup scripts or policies.
  - Include context in log messages (e.g., which URL, which proxy, which user agent).
  - **Tip:** Use different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) appropriately.

### 6. **Update Requirements and Dependencies**
- **Why:** Version pinning ensures reproducibility and prevents breakage from upstream changes.
- **How:**
  - Pin all dependencies in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `selenium==4.10.0`).
  - Remove or correct `MagicMock` (use `mock` or `unittest.mock`).
  - Add a script or Makefile target to check/install dependencies.
  - **Tip:** Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after testing.

### 7. **Expand and Improve Testing**
- **Why:** Tests catch bugs early and give confidence to refactor and extend the codebase.
- **How:**
  - Add unit tests for all modules, including utilities and site detection.
  - Write integration tests that simulate real scraping sessions.
  - Add end-to-end tests for the full workflow (from input to output file).
  - Set up CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests on every push.
  - **Tip:** Aim for high test coverage, but focus on critical paths first.

### 8. **Synchronize Documentation**
- **Why:** Accurate docs help users, contributors, and your future self.
- **How:**
  - Update README and developer docs to match the actual codebase and usage.
  - Add code examples, troubleshooting, and clear contribution guidelines.
  - Document all configuration options and expected file formats.
  - **Tip:** Use diagrams and flowcharts for complex workflows.

---

## **Phase 2: Professionalization & Best Practices**

### 1. **Adopt a Consistent Code Style**
- **Why:** Consistent style improves readability and reduces merge conflicts.
- **How:**
  - Apply PEP8 formatting using tools like `black` or `autopep8`.
  - Use `flake8` or `pylint` for linting.
  - Add pre-commit hooks to enforce style and run tests before every commit.
  - **Tip:** Document your style guide in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### 2. **Modularize and Decouple Components**
- **Why:** Modular code is easier to test, maintain, and extend.
- **How:**
  - Refactor large modules into smaller, focused ones.
  - Use dependency injection for components like proxies and user agents.
  - Avoid circular dependencies by careful module design.
  - **Example:** Separate scraping logic from data extraction and storage.

### 3. **Configuration Management**
- **Why:** Centralized, flexible configs make the project easier to use and deploy.
- **How:**
  - Move all settings to a single config file (YAML or JSON).
  - Allow overrides via environment variables for secrets or deployment.
  - Validate config files at startup and provide helpful errors.
  - **Tip:** Document all config options in the README.

### 4. **Robust Error Handling and Recovery**
- **Why:** Resilient scrapers can handle real-world web instability.
- **How:**
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for network requests.
  - Save partial results if a scrape fails midway.
  - Add alerts or notifications for critical failures.
  - **Example:** If a proxy fails, automatically switch and retry.

### 5. **Security and Privacy**
- **Why:** Respecting site policies and user privacy builds trust and avoids legal issues.
- **How:**
  - Sanitize all inputs and outputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - Add an option to respect `robots.txt` and site scraping policies.
  - Never log sensitive data (e.g., credentials, API keys).
  - **Tip:** Document ethical scraping practices in your docs.

### 6. **Performance Optimization**
- **Why:** Faster, more efficient scrapers save time and resources.
- **How:**
  - Add support for asynchronous scraping (e.g., `asyncio`, `aiohttp`).
  - Use smart throttling and adaptive delays to avoid bans.
  - Profile and optimize slow code paths.
  - **Example:** Parallelize requests for multi-page scrapes.

### 7. **Packaging and Distribution**
- **Why:** Easy installation and usage attract more users and contributors.
- **How:**
  - Make the project pip-installable with a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`.
  - Add a CLI interface for common tasks (e.g., `scraper run --url ...`).
  - Prepare for publishing on PyPI and/or as a Docker image.
  - **Tip:** Add usage badges and install instructions to your README.
